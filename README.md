# Neurobridge
NeuroBridge is a research project from data collection to implementing it into AI for peer tutoring optimization.
*For this project, there are 3 phases:*
1. Data Collection (HTML,CSS,JavaScript)
2. Data Analysis (Python or Pandas)
3. AI Implementation (Machine Learning)
# Current Phase: Data Collection
Drive:"Is it possible to use machine learning for creating effective peer tutoring matches?"
